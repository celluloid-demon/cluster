NFS
===

__NOTES:__

- Don't forget to add whitelist entry for each new node's ip! (Hint: You may have to restart nfs for changes to take effect and shares to be mounted correctly.)
- It is not uncommon for sqlite and other databases to be corrupted over NFSv3. Reports of that happening over v4 are much less common.
